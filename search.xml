        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I‚Äôm sad that I could only get temporary happiness from vanity, for example, high score, phd degree. I have no friend and I have lost my old friend. Even those who claimed to understand me had finally disappeared from my life. And I even appreciate those respond to my message in time. Maybe just like the story of <em>Dune</em>, finally when I got better and stronger, I will lost all my friends. Maybe pursuit for money isn‚Äôt so profane, as long as one can gain happiness there.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first day of lifting segregation. At noon I went to Second Canteen for lunch, it was a long but plesant walk. During the road I met some cats. And at 4 p.m., after I took some cat food, I went to feed some cats around my dormitory. These cats seemed to starve for a long time as no one could feed them during segregation.</p><p>At night, wje asked me a translation of hardronic light-by-light scattering. I didn‚Äôt know the answer as well but I searched on google and found a slide explaining this then I answered her. And our talkd ended. How I wished to have a casual talk but absolutely no.</p><p>Besides, I recalled some talks with mom during spring festival holiday. Whenever I mentioned buy something, she always said you had got money, and you could buy it. When dad asked if we needed an air conditioner, I said yes, mom said next year you installed air conditioner with your own salary. When she said about my translation e-pen, and wanted to give mine to my younger sister, I said now new e-pens with more functions are available and costed only four hundred yuan while my old ones were outdated. She said again I had money, I bought one for my sister. And she mentioned my neighbourhood whose son earned his fortune by doing business from time to time. Though she sometimes told me not to think too much and do the work I like, but I still felt she was giving me pressure. While the son of my neighbour got only a plain academic qualification, I was a doctor student at SJTU, one of the best school in Shanghai. But I have got nothing. No money, no work, and no girlfriend. </p><p>Somehow, I feel isolated, no one cares my emotional need. I wanted someone to confide my worries but I can‚Äôt. And probably this will never be satisfied. I have to go through these times myself. The only place I could trust was my own blog here, where nobody knows the domain.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Christmas day, also the day for the College Graduate Entrance Examination. I got up at 11:00 a.m. because of insomnia until 6 a.m.. After getting up, we went to McDonald to prepare for the English Presentation. But sadly it‚Äôs closed for two hours for disinfection. Then we went back to science building and prepared presentation at the meeting room for Department of Astrophysics. It took hours before we finished, probably at 8 p.m.. Next week is the last week of the semester. On Tuesday, I have to supervise an exam, and grade their last homework before Thursday. Life is hard, but it will end.<br>Lately I am worrying about work after graduation. Whether I should learn more coding and work on Internet. And the threshold to get a lifetime postion of professor is so hard. Finally, I have decided to go further research in physics. Life is too short, be a programmer may receive high salary. But it‚Äôs probably not what I love. Besides, programmer is highly replacable, I need creative work. And finally I tumbled to the idea that consistency is the essential ability. So just keep going, be a physicist.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Times flies, the new session has started for two months. And the real pressure of Phd life has finally emerged. Homework after homework, mid-term exam to prepare, and time-sonsuming Teaching Assistant work.</p><p>First few weeks at SJTU, the lectures were easy, the facilities were new and salary was high compared with other schools, and life was happy those days. Recently my emotions were quite out of control. Partly because I was not accustomed to this high pressure life, and I‚Äôm always worrying that I will fail the exam. Although there‚Äôre students not better than me, but they seem to be quite calm. After discussing with some senior student. They told me their first year as Phd student was quite easy. Review only days before exam. Heard this news, I thought I was not bad though. Do what I should do, and the following depends on destiny. I believe professors won‚Äôt make things difficult for students.</p><p>Finally, anxiety is really a negative emotion. Even if I‚Äôm not fully prepared, I should still believe if I have done what I could done, then there‚Äôs no regret.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>üéÇ As I am turning 37, I put together a list of 3 undervalued and 7 overvalued things in life. </p><p>3Ô∏è‚É£ Undervalued</p><ol><li><p>Sleep. Sleep gives a boost to immunity, creativity and psychological well-being. </p></li><li><p>Nature. Nature is the environment that we are biologically designed to feel good in. </p></li><li><p>Solitude. Being alone offers the freedom to make spiritual and intellectual breakthroughs. </p></li></ol><p>7Ô∏è‚É£ Overvalued</p><ol><li><p>Big cities. Big cities are sources of pollution, crime and noise. It‚Äôs good to have access to their resources, but advisable to live outside their borders.</p></li><li><p>Restaurants. Restaurants offer the slowest and least efficient way to eat. Cooking at home allows for healthier diets and more control over ingredients.</p></li><li><p>Hot weather. Sunny weather can bring about not only a lax attitude, but also a risk of cancer and faster aging. Colder temperatures, on the contrary, clarify spirit, body and mind.</p></li><li><p>Fashion. The endless quest to conform with ever-changing trends is expensive and unnecessary. Focusing on comfortable clothes makes life simpler and frees space for things that matter.</p></li><li><p>Real estate. Buying real estate often limits one‚Äôs choices and is a questionable investment. Renting gives more freedom to move and explore different locations.</p></li><li><p>Social media. The incessant flow of junk cluttering our minds from social media decreases our happiness and creativity. Disconnecting from these internet services is the best thing we can do on any given day.</p></li><li><p>Celebrity advice. Famous people often give unwarranted advice outside their fields of expertise. For all important things in life, it‚Äôs best to rely on hard science and expert opinion.</p></li></ol>]]></content>
