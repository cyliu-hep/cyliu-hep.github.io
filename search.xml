        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Christmas day, also the day for the College Graduate Entrance Examination. I got up at 11:00 a.m. because of insomnia until 6 a.m.. After getting up, we went to McDonald to prepare for the English Presentation. But sadly it‚Äôs closed for two hours for disinfection. Then we went back to science building and prepared presentation at the meeting room for Department of Astrophysics. It took hours before we finished, probably at 8 p.m.. Next week is the last week of the semester. On Tuesday, I have to supervise an exam, and grade their last homework before Thursday. Life is hard, but it will end.<br>Lately I am worrying about work after graduation. Whether I should learn more coding and work on Internet. And the threshold to get a lifetime postion of professor is so hard. Finally, I have decided to go further research in physics. Life is too short, be a programmer may receive high salary. But it‚Äôs probably not what I love. Besides, programmer is highly replacable, I need creative work. And finally I tumbled to the idea that consistency is the essential ability. So just keep going, be a physicist.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Times flies, the new session has started for two months. And the real pressure of Phd life has finally emerged. Homework after homework, mid-term exam to prepare, and time-sonsuming Teaching Assistant work.</p><p>First few weeks at SJTU, the lectures were easy, the facilities were new and salary was high compared with other schools, and life was happy those days. Recently my emotions were quite out of control. Partly because I was not accustomed to this high pressure life, and I‚Äôm always worrying that I will fail the exam. Although there‚Äôre students not better than me, but they seem to be quite calm. After discussing with some senior student. They told me their first year as Phd student was quite easy. Review only days before exam. Heard this news, I thought I was not bad though. Do what I should do, and the following depends on destiny. I believe professors won‚Äôt make things difficult for students.</p><p>Finally, anxiety is really a negative emotion. Even if I‚Äôm not fully prepared, I should still believe if I have done what I could done, then there‚Äôs no regret.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>üéÇ As I am turning 37, I put together a list of 3 undervalued and 7 overvalued things in life. </p><p>3Ô∏è‚É£ Undervalued</p><ol><li><p>Sleep. Sleep gives a boost to immunity, creativity and psychological well-being. </p></li><li><p>Nature. Nature is the environment that we are biologically designed to feel good in. </p></li><li><p>Solitude. Being alone offers the freedom to make spiritual and intellectual breakthroughs. </p></li></ol><p>7Ô∏è‚É£ Overvalued</p><ol><li><p>Big cities. Big cities are sources of pollution, crime and noise. It‚Äôs good to have access to their resources, but advisable to live outside their borders.</p></li><li><p>Restaurants. Restaurants offer the slowest and least efficient way to eat. Cooking at home allows for healthier diets and more control over ingredients.</p></li><li><p>Hot weather. Sunny weather can bring about not only a lax attitude, but also a risk of cancer and faster aging. Colder temperatures, on the contrary, clarify spirit, body and mind.</p></li><li><p>Fashion. The endless quest to conform with ever-changing trends is expensive and unnecessary. Focusing on comfortable clothes makes life simpler and frees space for things that matter.</p></li><li><p>Real estate. Buying real estate often limits one‚Äôs choices and is a questionable investment. Renting gives more freedom to move and explore different locations.</p></li><li><p>Social media. The incessant flow of junk cluttering our minds from social media decreases our happiness and creativity. Disconnecting from these internet services is the best thing we can do on any given day.</p></li><li><p>Celebrity advice. Famous people often give unwarranted advice outside their fields of expertise. For all important things in life, it‚Äôs best to rely on hard science and expert opinion.</p></li></ol>]]></content>
